  <div class="collapse-content js-rules-target" style="display: none;">
  <p>We'll keep it simple:</p>

  <h3>Rules</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>There's no minimum number of people required to play, but scores are only recorded for games of 2-4 players. In the case of long lines at the machines, solo gamers and smaller groups will be asked to play in groups of up to four.</li>
    <li>There's no limit to how many times you can play! Just return to the line after your round is over and scores are reported.</li>
    <li>No teams. Sorry!</li>
    <li>Be nice to each other!</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Scoring</h3>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Only the winning score from games of two or more players will be recorded.</strong> If you are the winner of a multiplayer round, report your name and score to Adaptiva staff at the booth table.</li>
    <li>There are no restrictions on player names on the leaderboard, but please help us out and try to keep it simple.<br><br> By default, we will enter first name and last initial. If you have a gamer tag you'd like to use, we'll be happy to comply unless it's, like, 38 characters long.<br><br>No inappropriate player names, please.</li>
  </ol>
