We had a bunch of remote employees at Adaptiva HQ in Bellevue, WA recently, so we took a trip to downtown and went bowling at <a href="http://www.bowlluckystrike.com/locations/bellevue/" target="_blank">Lucky Strike</a>. Lucky Strike is an upscale bowling alley with lane-side food service and lounges.

Colored lighting and interesting decor screamed, "FILM ME!" to Adam and me, so we made sure to bring some gear. Check out the short video we put together:

Equipped with the trusty Sony A7 and the 55mm f/1.8 Zeiss lens they make for it, we grabbed a few drinks ourselves and took some photos.
