We've been busy, and there's a bunch of other stuff I need to write about, but since this is a major addition to this particular site, it's getting bumped to the front of the writing queue.

Today, Adam and I have launched [The Lab](https://design.adaptiva.com/lab/) â€” a digital playground of sorts where we'll host web development projects, ranging from fun experiments to in-house solutions that solve real-world problems.

I'm gonna level with you: I built the Lab UI in one day, a lot of which happened during a company party with more than a little alcohol involved. It does feel a little plain and basic right now, so maybe we can spruce it up in the future.

Someday, I hope to build and store a full UI component library within the structure of the lab to help document and standardize web-dev practices at Adaptiva.

## The First Lab Kit
We've been hiring a lot of engineers lately, and I'm sure their email signatures (if they even have one) are more than a little off-brand. So, I coded out a little form that generates inline-styled markup that can be accurately copied and pasted into an email signature.

<a class="button" href="/lab/email-signature-generator/" title="View the Adaptiva Email Signature Generator">Check it Out</a>

I'm excited to keep building new things and continuing to learn and improve in the field of web development. Don't forget to subscribe for new Design Lab updates:
