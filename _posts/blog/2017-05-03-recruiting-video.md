Jesse and I got the chance to interview one of our new software engineers and make a video, showcasing what it's like working at Adaptiva. Eric is new to the team, so it was cool getting a fresh perspective of his experience so far.

The video was shot using a Sony A7 with the Zeiss 24-70mm lens and Sennheiser's Lavalier System with ZOOM H4n for audio. Eric was very natural, so the video turned out clean and genuine.

Enjoy!
