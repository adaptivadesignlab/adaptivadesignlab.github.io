Adaptiva is a leading, global provider of IT systems management solutions that advance the power of Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). Founded in 2004 by the lead architect of Microsoft SMS 2003, Adaptiva enables IT professionals to securely speed enterprise-wide software deployments without adding costly servers or throttling network bandwidth.

The company’s breakthrough peer-to-peer systems management technology uses intelligence, automation, and bandwidth optimization techniques to distribute content faster than any other systems management solution available today.

We are a results-driven company that invests in hard-working, genuine, talented, and creative employees who don’t settle for anything short of their best work. Much of Adaptiva’s success can be attributed to adherence to our four core values:

## Integrity
Working at Adaptiva means absolute honesty and transparency in the way we do business, with coworkers, customers, and partners.

## Excellence
We believe in going the extra mile to deliver our best work in everything we do, every time.

## Work Ethic
Adaptiva promotes a self-driven work environment, and our staff achieve results without being micro-managed.

## Dignity of Labor
We never ask anyone to do something we wouldn’t do ourselves. Being an executive doesn’t mean you can’t do the dishes.

## Our Mission
To create software that changes the way companies can scale and distribute content, and to enable our customers, partners, and employees to do the best work of their careers.
