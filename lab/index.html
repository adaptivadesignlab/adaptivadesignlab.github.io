		<h2><strong>Welcome to The Lab!</strong></h2>
		<p>This is where the Adaptiva creative team (a.k.a. the Design Lab) flexes our web-dev skills. Here we'll be creating and hosting in-house tools, random experiments, and hopefully a full Adaptiva UI kit someday.</p>
		<p>Everything you see here is coded from scratch in house, built entirely on our own custom HTML/CSS/JS frameworks (plus some good ol' jQuery).</p>
		<p>You can find this whole website and all of its source code on <a href="https://github.com/adaptivadesignlab/adaptivadesignlab.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>.</p>
		<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
